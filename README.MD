##Reflection 

This project took some time, some trial and error lot's of googling and it taught me a lot of new tools. The one I was able to get the most use out of was the nulish coalescing operator. As I looked for examples to follow through the project it came up alot, so I am good with it now. I started first with the logic for the home page to fetch the data properly, seemingly simple but not with typescript. So it ended up being hours of stem by step on google. How do you do this? and That and that? and so on. Very long and draw out but soon patterns started to emerge. That made it easier and my understanding of the process depened because of that.  

I deeply understand DOM manipulation and array/string methods so those were not an issue. The type control required with TS was again my most daunting task through all of it, but the nullish coalescing operator was the way I was able to handle that part efficiently and when things did not work I again just ent to google, slow, but effective. Sometimes the solutions I would find would be a bit advanced I implemented those advanced concepts where I could understand them and if it was too much or orverkill I tried to keep it simple and readable for me and hopefully anyone else reading the code who might use it to learn. 

Thing I would change, this one is tough because this is based off of a frontend mentor challenge, so my first answer was no not really. But upon reflection figma would have been useful here. So I would have liked to have had that, but I leaned on other tools for the CSS, so I found my answers there.

Lastly I will create a live demo of the site through gethub.
